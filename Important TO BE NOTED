You would have to add your own image of logo in ico format 
and background image in jpg format as shown in the video.
Also you have to download Pillow where it is written 
"from PIL import ImageTk,Image"-Right click to download PIL,
you would see two options, "PIL" and "Pillow" one of them will
give an error but it is ok, proceed with the other one
